                    <p>My development experience includes building clean and concise code with an emphasis on useability and accesibility.
                        I've built numerous static web pages in HTML,
                        used tools such as CSS to implememnt design changes, 
                        as well as incorporated javascript functionality.

                        developers within my volunteer organization on a variety of areas. Areas 
                        such as updating existing code bases, new feature deployment, and debugging.

            <div class="about-me__body">
                <p>Just a little bit about me personally. I've always been a pretty active person throughout my life. Playing sports as a child and well into adulthood
                    was something I always wanted to make sure I kept up with. Ice hockey was always what I played the most and still do, but very recently my girlfriend
                    and I have taken a serious interest in hiking (see one such hike in Seattle, Washington pictured here), as well as skiing!
                </p>
                <p>I've always had a huge interest in technology and a passion for learning as much as possible about it. Just within the last couple of years I built my
                    first PC and started my jounrey with learning to code. It's been an amazing process and I couldn't be happier I made the leap into this field. My only
                    regret is that I didn't start sooner.
